Random Astrology Message Generator

This simple random message generator will produce senteces about astrology.

First we have divided the sentence we want to create onto 4 arrays.

Array variable sign containing all the Zodiac signs.
Array variable date containing all the dates for the Zodiac signs.
Array variable randLink containing the part of the sentence between the Zodiac sign and the dates it belongs, there is multiple different pieces of sentences as this part of the message will be also random.
Array variable randEnd containin different endings for our sentece.

Funcion created to generate the random sentence.

Finally we have produce a few console logs calling our function to show the message is random every time.

Funcion added if calling the message generator multiple times it will generate a different zodiac sign than previously generated, same for the ending of the sentence. This of course is to maximize how random the next message would be when the ammount of calls to the function is less than the length of our arrays.
